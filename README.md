# Pacific Adaptation Gap Atlas

An exploratory, map-first data visualization project for the **Pacific Dataviz Challenge 2026** climate-change theme.

Competition deadline: **August 31, 2026**

## What This Project Is

The Pacific Adaptation Gap Atlas is an interactive web atlas about climate adaptation signals across Pacific geographies. It combines official climate, stress, monitoring, and capacity datasets into a careful exploratory view of where climate pressure and visible adaptation capacity appear out of balance.

The project is being built as a web visualization because the strongest competition entries are interactive, visual, and story-driven. The intended final artifact is not a generic dashboard. It is a GIS-flavored atlas with a guided story path and exploratory map controls.

## Core Question

> Where do official climate-pressure, observed-stress, adaptation-capacity, monitoring, and missingness signals appear most out of balance across Pacific geographies?

The atlas is designed to help readers inspect:

- where the adaptation gap appears wide,
- what is driving the gap,
- where official evidence is strong or thin,
- where monitoring rows report zero,
- where monitoring rows are missing,
- why rank order should be treated cautiously.

The central story is not "who is worst." It is:

> Across Pacific geographies, climate pressure and visible adaptation capacity are unevenly matched, and so is the official data behind the comparison.

## Data

The project uses official Pacific Dataviz Challenge 2026 datasets listed in:

```text
research/official_datasets_2026.csv
```

Current priority dataset families include:

- sea-surface temperature anomalies,
- surface temperature anomalies,
- rainfall anomalies,
- sea-level anomalies,
- directly affected persons attributed to disasters,
- meteorological monitoring network,
- power generation,
- fisheries management measures,
- greenhouse gas emissions per capita as context only.

Generated analysis and app-ready outputs live under:

```text
artifacts/
data/processed/
app/public/data/
```

Important caveats:

- The Adaptation Gap Index is a comparative screen, not a definitive rank of need or vulnerability.
- Current map geometry uses centroid fallback, not official boundaries.
- Missing monitoring rows mean a reporting gap in the processed official data, not confirmed absence of infrastructure.
- Outlook outputs are stress-test context, not forecasts.

## Install

Python requirements are declared in `pyproject.toml`.

```powershell
python -m pip install -e .
```

JavaScript dependencies are declared in the root workspace and app package files.

```powershell
npm install
```

## Validate The Repo

```powershell
python scripts/check_required_artifacts.py
python scripts/validate_task_statuses.py
python scripts/check_secrets.py
```

Equivalent npm shortcuts:

```powershell
npm run validate:artifacts
npm run validate:tasks
npm run check:secrets
```

## Rebuild Data Products

Profile official datasets:

```powershell
python scripts/profile_datasets.py --config configs/datasets.yml
```

Build processed observations:

```powershell
python scripts/make_dataset.py --config configs/datasets.yml
```

Build the baseline adaptation gap index:

```powershell
python scripts/build_gap_index.py --config configs/gap_index.yml
```

Build the outlook stress test:

```powershell
python scripts/run_outlook.py --config configs/outlook.yml
```

Build app-ready data:

```powershell
python scripts/build_app_data.py --config configs/app_layers.yml
python scripts/validate_data_contracts.py
```

Run EDA:

```powershell
python scripts/run_eda.py --config configs/eda.yml
```

## Run The App

Start the atlas mockup:

```powershell
npm run app:dev
```

Build the app:

```powershell
npm run app:build
```

The current app is still a mockup and not the final competition submission.
