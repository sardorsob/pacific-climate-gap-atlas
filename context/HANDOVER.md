# Handover

## Current State

The repository is initialized as a context-first GIS/data-science project. `TASK-001` through `TASK-005` are complete: nine priority official datasets have been profiled, contracted, cached, normalized, scored into a baseline Adaptation Gap Index, stress-tested with an app-optional outlook baseline, and exported into enriched app-ready JSON/GeoJSON. The core EDA/story sprint is complete, `TASK-020` records a Dataviz Inspiration audit, TASK-019 evidence-fingerprint divergence artifacts exist, and the React/Vite app now opens as a scroll-led guided atlas with a free-explore handoff backed by generated public app data. `TASK-026` is complete: the map surface now uses MapLibre with centroid fallback points, overlay labels, and accessible geography hit targets. The remaining `TASK-006` app work is split into `TASK-028` story/copy rewrite and `TASK-027` post-map visual polish before `TASK-007` final readiness.

## How To Validate The Scaffold

```powershell
python scripts/check_required_artifacts.py
python scripts/validate_task_statuses.py
python scripts/check_secrets.py
```

## How To Rebuild The Dataset Profile

```powershell
python scripts/profile_datasets.py --config configs/datasets.yml
```

If `python` is not on PATH inside Codex Desktop, use the bundled runtime shown by `load_workspace_dependencies`.

## How To Rebuild Processed Data

```powershell
python scripts/make_dataset.py --config configs/datasets.yml
```

The script uses `data/raw/official/*.csv` first. If you manually download official SDMX CSV files, use the filenames listed in `data/raw/README.md`.

## How To Rebuild The Gap Index

```powershell
python scripts/build_gap_index.py --config configs/gap_index.yml
```

## How To Rebuild The Outlook

```powershell
python scripts/run_outlook.py --config configs/outlook.yml
```

## How To Rebuild App Data

```powershell
python scripts/build_app_data.py --config configs/app_layers.yml
python scripts/validate_data_contracts.py
```

This writes app data under `data/processed/app/`, mirrors the website-facing files to `app/public/data/`, and records `artifacts/provenance/app_data_summary.json`.

## GIS Context

`data/external/geography_context.csv` adds descriptive subregion, political-status, administering/sovereign authority, and island-group context for all scored geographies. Keep these fields outside score calculations. Review sensitive status wording before publication and keep centroid-first mapping until a boundary source is chosen.

## How To Rebuild The EDA Foundation

```powershell
python scripts/run_eda.py --config configs/eda.yml
```

This writes the script-first EDA tables under `artifacts/tables/` and records `artifacts/provenance/eda_summary.json`. It now includes coverage deep dives, indicator forensics, country story labels, rank volatility, trend profiles, monitoring-gap GIS story priorities, and TASK-019 Evidence Fingerprint Divergence outputs. Read `context/ANALYSIS_BRIEF.md`, `context/STORY_BRIEF.md`, `context/DESIGN_BRIEF.md`, `context/DATAVIZ_INSPIRATION_AUDIT.md`, `context/WINNER_SCROLL_TOUR_AUDIT.md`, and `context/INFORMATION_DIVERGENCE_PLAN.md` before resuming app or design work around the similarity layer.

## Next Recommended Work

1. Run `TASK-028` story/copy rewrite before the final visual polish so Claude is polishing real claims, not placeholder text.
2. Run `TASK-027` only after the MapLibre substrate and revised story copy exist.
3. Keep Codex QA as the gate for any Claude visual/app changes before committing, and keep owner visual review as the taste/approval gate.
4. Treat reviewed polygon boundaries as a future data-source task, not as part of the completed `TASK-026` MapLibre substrate.

## Known Caveats

- In a fresh checkout, install app and Python dependencies before rebuilding. The local working copy has previously run the Vite build successfully.
- The SDMX fetch helper avoids undeclared runtime dependencies, but uses a Windows PowerShell fallback because the endpoint returned `422` to Python standard-library HTTP.
- Raw official CSV cache files under `data/raw/official/` are ignored by Git.
- The gap index is a draft comparative baseline. The app must show indicator counts, trace details, and methodology caveats near the score.
- The outlook baseline is app-optional. Only include it in the interface with visible caveats and row-level notes.
- TASK-005/TASK-026 GIS exports and map layers use centroid fallback geometry, not island boundaries. The app now uses MapLibre for the map canvas, but boundary polygons are still not joined.
- TASK-010 GIS context is descriptive and boundary-neutral. It can support grouping and app copy, but not scoring.
- TASK-011 coverage tables show PN as the only current data-desert geography; broader coverage caveats are mostly dataset-specific rather than geography-wide.
- TASK-012 indicator forensics preserve all 182 trace rows and flag 11 within-indicator outliers. GHG outliers for NC and PW are context-only, not score drivers.
- TASK-013 country story labels are descriptive screens for app copy and story selection, not causal explanations.
- TASK-015 spatial typologies are rule-based descriptors, not statistical clusters or adjacency claims.
- TASK-014 leave-one-indicator sensitivity shows rank volatility is widespread. Avoid definitive rank-order language; use rankings as exploratory context with visible uncertainty.
- TASK-016 outlook interpretation is stress-test display guidance, not forecasting. Weak or sparse diagnostics should be withheld from outlook layers.
- TASK-017 monitoring-gap outputs identify PN, NR, AS, and WF as high-gap low-monitoring candidates. AS and WF have missing monitoring rows, so describe them as reporting gaps unless externally verified.
- TASK-019 outputs exist as analysis artifacts: `eda_evidence_fingerprints.csv`, `eda_pairwise_jsd.csv`, `eda_similarity_neighbors.csv`, and `divergence_summary.json`. They are not app-wired; do not present similarity as shipped until app-ready export, caveats, and visual QA are complete.
- TASK-020 reference examples are principle studies only. Do not copy publication identity, palettes, layouts, illustrations, or iconic stripe treatments from audited projects.
- The implemented winner-audit response is a guided scroll atlas, not a long cinematic landing page. The first viewport must still show the map and evidence.
- TASK-022 belonged to Claude, but Claude did not stage, commit, push, change data methodology, or alter generated artifacts.
- TASK-024 QA is complete for the accepted TASK-022 revision. Future Claude visual or copy changes should go through the same Codex QA gate before commit.
- TASK-021 found a concrete first-fix issue: the desktop legend was hidden inside a closed `<details>` disclosure whose summary was hidden. That issue was fixed in the accepted mockup revision.
- The copied reference workflow kits are intentionally ignored under `context/`.
- TASK-022/TASK-024 visual revisions are accepted after Codex QA. The accepted app shell includes the scroll-led guided mode, story components, map/panel components, and CSS changes. No data methodology, generated artifacts, raw data, or git history were delegated to Claude.
- After TASK-022, the desktop default no longer shows a detail panel; the panel is a right-side overlay (bottom sheet on mobile) that opens on selection or the data-quiet view, and the thesis lives in the map header. The desktop legend is now visible by default (the closed-`<details>` P0 bug is fixed).
- Codex QA fixes applied before commit: render the detail panel only when selection or data-quiet mode is active, open the data-quiet sheet when that overlay is toggled, encode graticule degree labels with ASCII source escapes, and normalize CSS letter spacing to `0`.
- Remaining owner-review notes: the mobile top toolbar is horizontally scrollable by design; confirm visual taste and discoverability in the next browser review. Codex did not capture fresh screenshots during QA because local Playwright import was blocked by filesystem permissions, so the acceptance is based on source review, app build, validation checks, and Claude's reported viewport review. The "vs Tuvalu" comparator is a label-only suggestion, not the TASK-019 JSD layer.
- TASK-025 is complete. The app loads generated `/data/geographies.json` through `app/src/lib/atlasData.ts`; the obsolete `app/src/mock/mockAtlasData.ts` fixture was deleted. The generated app contract now carries monitoring status, rank uncertainty, story labels, top signals, status/subregion context, and outlook display gating.
- TASK-026 is complete as a MapLibre centroid substrate. TASK-028 and TASK-027 remain pending child tasks under the open TASK-006 app shell, followed by TASK-007 submission readiness.
- Completed transient mockup plan/checklist files were pruned from `context/plans/`; their durable outcomes now live in `TASKS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `HANDOVER.md`, `DESIGN_BRIEF.md`, and the progress log.
