# Project

## Current Phase

TASK-029 Natural Earth Pacific land context is complete; next build gate is TASK-028 story/copy rewrite before final visual polish. Competition deadline: August 31, 2026.

## Status

The repository has a committed workflow scaffold, official dataset contracts, a reproducible processed data pipeline, a draft Adaptation Gap Index baseline, an app-optional Adaptation Gap Outlook baseline, enriched app-ready JSON/GeoJSON, script-first EDA outputs, TASK-019 evidence-fingerprint divergence artifacts, story/design briefs, a Dataviz Inspiration audit, a Pacific winner scroll-tour audit, and an accepted React/Vite scroll-led atlas shell wired to generated public data. The app map now uses a MapLibre canvas with centroid fallback points, Natural Earth visual land context, first-render graticule lines, and React overlay labels/hit targets. Remaining app work is organized as `TASK-028` story/copy rewrite, `TASK-027` post-map visual polish, and then `TASK-007` final methodology/accessibility/submission readiness.

## Working Title

The Pacific Adaptation Gap Atlas

## Current Thesis

Pacific island countries face climate burdens they did little to create, but the size and shape of the adaptation gap varies by geography. The project should help readers explore where climate signals, observed stress, monitoring coverage, and response-capacity proxies appear most out of balance.

## Last Session Notes

- Approved structure: context-first monorepo.
- Approved headline: broader adaptation gap, with monitoring as one diagnostic layer.
- Copied reference workflow kits into ignored local context paths.
- Completed `TASK-001` live dataset profiling and contracts for nine priority official datasets.
- Completed `TASK-002` processed data pipeline with local raw-cache support.
- Completed `TASK-003` baseline Adaptation Gap Index and methodology update.
- Completed `TASK-004` Adaptation Gap Outlook baseline and model-card update.
- Completed `TASK-005` app-data export with centroid GeoJSON, layer metadata, country details, and public app copies.
- Paused TASK-006 app build to run deeper GIS/story EDA first.
- Completed `TASK-009` script-first EDA foundation with analysis backlog, repeatable tables, and provenance.
- Completed `TASK-010` GIS context enrichment with descriptive subregion/status context and boundary-neutral caveats.
- Completed `TASK-011` coverage/data-desert analysis with geography-level and dataset-level coverage tables.
- Completed `TASK-012` indicator-level forensics with row-level trace preservation and within-dataset outlier flags.
- Completed `TASK-013` country story labels with pressure/capacity summaries, coverage caveats, and non-causal interpretation guardrails.
- Completed `TASK-015` spatial typologies and subregion comparisons with rule-based labels and regional caveats.
- Completed `TASK-016` trend/outlook interpretation with display/withhold recommendations for stress-test layers.
- Completed `TASK-017` monitoring-gap GIS story analysis with priority quadrants and reporting-gap caveats.
- Completed `TASK-018` story and design synthesis with `STORY_BRIEF.md` and `DESIGN_BRIEF.md`.
- Started `TASK-006` visual mockup pass with a buildable React/Vite atlas concept for owner review; final app wiring remains open.
- Added and completed `TASK-019` as an Evidence Fingerprint Divergence analysis lane so JSD ideas fit the official-data story without becoming a new leaderboard or overclaimed model.
- Completed `TASK-020` Dataviz Inspiration audit with live browser review of map/climate/environment references and updated the story, design, Claude mockup, decision, backlog, and memory context around full-bleed map, selected-anchor, compact evidence-strip, direct-label, and evidence-bearing-motion patterns.
- Organized the delegated sprint: Codex owned mockup critique and QA, Claude owned the visual revision pass, a Codex data agent completed `TASK-019`, and a Codex app-data agent completed the mock-to-public-data wiring inventory.
- Completed `TASK-021` mockup critique with a Claude-facing checklist; its durable outcome is consolidated into `TASKS.md`, `HANDOVER.md`, and the design brief.
- Completed and accepted `TASK-022` / `TASK-024`: Claude revised the visual mockup, Codex reviewed the code and context, applied small QA fixes, and prepared the accepted mockup revision for commit.
- Completed `TASK-023` app-data wiring inventory in `context/plans/app-data-wiring-inventory.md`. At inventory time, base scores and centroids were available while monitoring reporting status, rank uncertainty, story labels, top-signal arrays, political/status context, and outlook display gating still needed export/derivation; `TASK-025` has since completed that core wiring.
- Completed `TASK-019` Evidence Fingerprint Divergence with 22 geography fingerprints, 231 unordered pairwise JSD rows, 66 nearest-neighbor rows, and caveated provenance. Treat it as analysis-ready but not app-wired.
- Completed a Pacific Dataviz winner scroll-tour audit. Recommendation: pivot the next visual direction to a scroll-led hybrid that keeps the atlas map as the sticky evidence surface and preserves free exploration after the guided path.
- Accepted Claude's scroll-led hybrid implementation after Codex cleanup. The app now starts in a 7-beat guided atlas mode, uses the map as the sticky evidence surface, preserves "Explore freely" as the full-control handoff, and treats Evidence Fingerprint Divergence as a labelled static preview only.
- Reorganized the remaining `TASK-006` app work into `TASK-025` app-data wiring, `TASK-026` MapLibre substrate, `TASK-029` Pacific land context, `TASK-028` guided story/copy rewrite, and `TASK-027` post-map visual polish before `TASK-007` final readiness.
- Completed `TASK-025` real app-data wiring: app data exports now include monitoring, rank, story, context, and outlook-display objects; the React app loads `/data/geographies.json` through `app/src/lib/atlasData.ts`; the obsolete mock fixture was deleted.
- Completed `TASK-026` MapLibre map substrate: `AtlasMap` now renders a no-network MapLibre Pacific canvas with generated centroid point features, React overlay labels, accessible geography hit targets, monitoring hatching/dashed cues, selected/priority state, and explicit boundary-not-joined caveats. It does not ship polygon boundaries.
- Completed `TASK-029` Pacific land context: `scripts/build_land_context.py` builds and mirrors Natural Earth 10m land into the app, writes provenance, renders land under centroid points, and moves graticule lines into MapLibre so the grid appears on initial render.
