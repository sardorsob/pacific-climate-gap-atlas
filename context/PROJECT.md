# Project

## Current Phase

Data audit.

## Status

The repository has a committed workflow scaffold and a reproducible profile of the priority official datasets for the Pacific Dataviz Challenge 2026 interactive GIS atlas.

## Working Title

The Pacific Adaptation Gap Atlas

## Current Thesis

Pacific island countries face climate burdens they did little to create, but the size and shape of the adaptation gap varies by geography. The project should help readers explore where climate signals, observed stress, monitoring coverage, and response-capacity proxies appear most out of balance.

## Feature Table

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research source folder | present | `research/` includes brief, official dataset inventory, past winners, and review board |
| Workflow shell | done | all durable project Markdown lives under `context/` |
| Dataset profile | done | `artifacts/tables/dataset_profile.csv` and `data/contracts/*.json` cover nine priority official datasets |
| Data science pipeline | planned | Python modules and scripts will produce processed app data |
| GIS atlas app | planned | React/Vite/MapLibre scaffold will consume static app-ready data |
| Outlook model | planned | transparent baseline projection, not operational prediction |

## Last Session Notes

- Approved structure: context-first monorepo.
- Approved headline: broader adaptation gap, with monitoring as one diagnostic layer.
- Copied reference workflow kits into ignored local context paths.
- Completed `TASK-001` live dataset profiling and contracts for nine priority official datasets.
