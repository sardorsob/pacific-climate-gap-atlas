# Analysis Backlog

## Purpose

The project is pausing visual design work until the atlas has a stronger evidence base. This backlog defines the in-depth EDA and GIS-oriented analysis needed before a final app story, layout, and Claude visual-design handoff.

## Current Status

Completed analysis lanes now cover the script-first EDA foundation, GIS context, official-data coverage, indicator forensics, country story labels, rank volatility, spatial typologies, trend/outlook interpretation, monitoring-gap GIS priorities, story/design synthesis, the Dataviz Inspiration audit, and `TASK-019` Evidence Fingerprint Divergence. `TASK-025` wired the core app data contract; next app steps are `TASK-026` MapLibre/island geometry, `TASK-028` story/copy rewrite, and `TASK-027` final visual polish. Decide whether divergence ships in V1 before adding similarity fields to the app data contract.

## Principles

- Start from analytical questions, not chart ideas.
- Use Python modules and scripts as the source of truth; notebooks are optional review surfaces only.
- Save reportable outputs under `artifacts/` with stable names.
- Preserve caveats when scores depend on sparse data, proxy indicators, or centroid geometry.
- Treat GIS claims carefully while current geometry is centroid fallback rather than boundaries.

### TASK-019: Evidence Fingerprint Divergence

Question: Which geographies have similar or different official-data evidence profiles behind their adaptation-gap scores?

Status: implemented as an analysis artifact; app data export and UI are pending.

Analyses:
- build pressure, capacity, data-visibility, and combined evidence vectors from official-data-derived trace fields
- normalize each vector family with explicit missingness treatment
- compute pairwise Jensen-Shannon divergence across the 22 geographies
- optionally compute KL divergence only as an internal diagnostic after smoothing
- identify nearest evidence-profile neighbors for selected geographies
- identify cases where similar gap scores hide different evidence profiles
- identify cases where different scores share similar evidence fingerprints

### TASK-020: Dataviz Inspiration Audit

Question: Which live reference interaction patterns should inform the next atlas mockup without weakening originality or evidence discipline?

Analyses:
- sample Dataviz Inspiration map, choropleth, connection, bubble map, arc, ridgeline, hexbin, and heatmap routes
- inspect relevant original projects with live browser interaction
- extract durable patterns for full-bleed maps, selected-geography anchoring, compact evidence strips, direct labels, guided tours, and evidence-bearing motion
- identify risky patterns to avoid, including long pre-map intros, hover-only values, hidden caveats, and copied visual identities

Outputs:
- `context/DATAVIZ_INSPIRATION_AUDIT.md`
- updates to `context/STORY_BRIEF.md`
- updates to `context/DESIGN_BRIEF.md`
- updates to `context/CLAUDE_MOCKUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Parallelization Plan

- Coverage/data desert and GIS enrichment can run in parallel.
- Indicator forensics and driver decomposition can run in parallel after the current score artifacts are available.
- Sensitivity analysis can run independently from trend/outlook interpretation.
- Evidence fingerprint divergence has run after indicator forensics, country drivers, rank volatility, and monitoring-gap tables became available. It should be decided before adding similarity/fingerprint fields to a public app contract.
- The Dataviz Inspiration audit is complete and should inform visual critique immediately. It does not require new data artifacts.
- Story synthesis should use the completed TASK-018 brief as the story source of truth, with TASK-019 now available as an optional selected-geography comparison layer rather than the primary narrative spine.
