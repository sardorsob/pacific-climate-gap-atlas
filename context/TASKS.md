## TASK-000
- Phase: scaffold
- Title: Initialize context-first project workflow shell
- Depends on: none
- Assigned agent: Codex
- Contract refs: context/AGENTS.md, context/SCOPE.md
- Data refs: research/pacific_dataviz_2026_research_brief.md
- Scientific refs: context/DATA_CARD.md
- User value / decision value: Makes the project understandable and ready for task-based commits before feature work starts.
- Functional notes: Keep all durable planning/status/problem/task Markdown under `context/`.
- Statistical notes: No model or index results are produced by this task.
- Edge cases: Copied reference workflow kits must remain ignored and uncommitted.
- Files to create/modify: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `configs/*`, `context/*`, `analysis/*`, `scripts/*`, `app/*`, `data/*`, `artifacts/*`, `tests/*`
- Artifacts to produce: initial scaffold and validation scripts
- Acceptance criteria: Required context files exist; reference kits are ignored; validation scripts pass; initial commit uses scaffold commit message.
- Verification commands: `python scripts/check_required_artifacts.py`; `python scripts/validate_task_statuses.py`; `python scripts/check_secrets.py`
- Manual QA: Inspect `git status --short --ignored` and confirm ignored workflow kits are not staged.
- QA notes: Passed `python scripts/check_required_artifacts.py`, `python scripts/validate_task_statuses.py`, and `python scripts/check_secrets.py`. Verified copied workflow kits are ignored by Git while project context files are trackable.

- User value / decision value: Creates the central comparison layer for the atlas.
- Functional notes: Compute climate pressure, capacity, adaptation gap score, and missingness flags.
- Statistical notes: Use transparent percentile-rank normalization; do not impute primary score values.
- Edge cases: Geographies without capacity data should show insufficient-data state rather than a fake score.

- User value / decision value: Adds a cautious future-facing layer if the data supports it.
- Functional notes: Estimate climate-signal trends and combine with capacity scenarios.
- Statistical notes: Use time-aware evaluation and compare against a naive baseline.
- Edge cases: Sparse time series should be excluded from projections and labeled in the app.
