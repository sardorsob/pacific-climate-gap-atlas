- Assigned agent: Codex
- Contract refs: context/AGENTS.md, context/SCOPE.md
- Data refs: research/pacific_dataviz_2026_research_brief.md
- Scientific refs: context/DATA_CARD.md
- User value / decision value: Makes the project understandable and ready for task-based commits before feature work starts.
- Functional notes: Keep all durable planning/status/problem/task Markdown under `context/`.
- Statistical notes: No model or index results are produced by this task.
- Edge cases: Copied reference workflow kits must remain ignored and uncommitted.
- Files to create/modify: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `configs/*`, `context/*`, `analysis/*`, `scripts/*`, `app/*`, `data/*`, `artifacts/*`, `tests/*`
- Artifacts to produce: initial scaffold and validation scripts
- Acceptance criteria: Required context files exist; reference kits are ignored; validation scripts pass; initial commit uses scaffold commit message.
- Verification commands: `python scripts/check_required_artifacts.py`; `python scripts/validate_task_statuses.py`; `python scripts/check_secrets.py`
- Manual QA: Inspect `git status --short --ignored` and confirm ignored workflow kits are not staged.
- QA notes: Passed `python scripts/check_required_artifacts.py`, `python scripts/validate_task_statuses.py`, and `python scripts/check_secrets.py`. Verified copied workflow kits are ignored by Git while project context files are trackable.
- Attempts: 1
- Max attempts: 2
- Attempt log: Initial scaffold implementation.
- Status: done

## TASK-001
- Phase: data-audit
- Title: Profile official 2026 datasets and create dataset contracts
- Depends on: TASK-000
- Assigned agent: Codex
- Contract refs: context/DATA_CARD.md, configs/datasets.yml
- Data refs: research/official_datasets_2026.csv
- Scientific refs: context/ASSUMPTIONS.md
- User value / decision value: Determines which official datasets are safe to use in the atlas and index.
- Functional notes: Use `scripts/profile_datasets.py` to produce row counts, geography coverage, year ranges, missingness, and API errors.
- Statistical notes: Do not fill missing values; expose coverage explicitly.
- Edge cases: Some official API URLs may return 422; record failures and fallback source links.
- Files to create/modify: `analysis/io/*`, `scripts/profile_datasets.py`, `data/contracts/*`, `artifacts/tables/*`, `context/DATA_CARD.md`
- Artifacts to produce: dataset profile table and contracts

- Verification commands: `python scripts/profile_datasets.py --config configs/datasets.yml`
- Manual QA: Spot-check sea-level and monitoring datasets against the official CSV inventory.
- QA notes: Added tested SDMX CSV profiling helpers, implemented `scripts/profile_datasets.py`, generated `artifacts/tables/dataset_profile.csv`, and wrote nine JSON dataset contracts under `data/contracts/`. Live profile returned 9/9 priority datasets with `ok` status. Spot-checked sea-level anomalies and meteorological monitoring network contracts against the official inventory URLs and expected coverage.
- Attempts: 1
- Max attempts: 3
- Attempt log: Built reproducible profile script and contracts; Python HTTP returned 422 for the SDMX endpoint, so the script uses a Windows PowerShell fallback with the configured SDMX CSV accept header.
- Status: done

- Edge cases: Geography codes may differ across datasets; create a lookup table with aliases.
- Files to create/modify: `scripts/fetch_official_data.py`, `scripts/make_dataset.py`, `analysis/preprocessing/*`, `data/processed/*`, `data/external/*`
- Artifacts to produce: processed long table, geography lookup, app JSON/GeoJSON draft
- Acceptance criteria: Pipeline can be rerun and produces deterministic files with row-count logs.
- Verification commands: `python scripts/make_dataset.py --config configs/datasets.yml`
- Manual QA: Confirm app-ready files include source references and last-updated metadata.
- QA notes: Added local-cache-first official data fetch script, normalized SDMX CSV rows into `data/processed/official_observations.csv`, wrote `data/processed/geography_lookup.csv`, exported `data/processed/app/atlas_dataset_summary.json`, and recorded provenance in `artifacts/provenance/dataset_pipeline_summary.json`. Pipeline output: 14,007 rows, 9 datasets, 22 geographies. Manual raw download filenames are documented in `data/raw/README.md`.
- Attempts: 1
- Max attempts: 3
- Attempt log: Built tested preprocessing helpers and reran `scripts/make_dataset.py --config configs/datasets.yml`; the script used the ignored raw cache when present and fetched missing official CSVs otherwise.
- Status: done

- Manual QA: Review top and bottom ranked geographies for obvious data artifacts.
- QA notes: Added tested baseline scoring helpers, implemented `scripts/build_gap_index.py`, generated `artifacts/tables/adaptation_gap_index.csv`, generated `artifacts/tables/adaptation_gap_indicator_trace.csv`, and wrote `artifacts/provenance/gap_index_summary.json`. Output includes 22 geographies, 22 scored geographies, 0 insufficient-data geographies, and 182 indicator trace rows. Manual QA reviewed top and bottom ranked geographies; PN, NR, AS, WF, and TV currently rank highest, while PF, FJ, NC, GU, and PG rank lowest under the draft method.
- Attempts: 1
- Max attempts: 3
- Attempt log: Built latest-observation percentile-rank baseline with anomaly magnitude scoring, no imputation, required climate/adaptation pillars, and trace rows for score auditability.
- Status: done

- Verification commands: `python scripts/run_outlook.py --config configs/outlook.yml`
- Manual QA: Compare outlook rankings to current gap rankings and investigate surprises.
- QA notes: Added tested outlook trend helpers, implemented `scripts/run_outlook.py`, generated `artifacts/tables/adaptation_gap_outlook.csv`, generated `artifacts/tables/climate_trend_diagnostics.csv`, wrote `artifacts/provenance/outlook_summary.json`, and produced a local ignored run bundle under `artifacts/logs/runs/task-004-outlook-baseline/`. Output includes 86 trend series, 88 projection rows, 86 backtested series, 39 series where linear trend beats naive, mean linear holdout MAE 1.7731, and mean naive holdout MAE 2.9953. Decision: methodology-ready and app-optional, not a primary prediction layer.
